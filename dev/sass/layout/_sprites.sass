// Spriting has never been easier with Compass. You place the sprite images in a folder, 
// import them into your stylesheet, and then you can use the sprite in your selectors 
// in one of several convenient ways.

// <map> is defined by folder name.

// $<map>-spacing: The amount of transparent space, in pixels, around each sprite. Defaults to 0px
$sprites-spacing: 20px

// $<map>-sprite-dimensions: Whether or not the dimensions of the sprite should be included in 
// each sprite's CSS output. Can be true or false. Defaults to false
$sprites-sprite-dimensions: true

// Folder containing sprites. As of right now only works with pngs.
@import "sprites/*.png"

// all-<map>-sprites: creates the css for the sprites. 
// Class names will be set by <map>-<image-name>
@include all-sprites-sprites
